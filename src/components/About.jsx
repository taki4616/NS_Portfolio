      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a career-changer and problem-solver who transitioned into tech after 20 years as a professional nanny. My path into software engineering was driven by a desire to build tools that help people and solve everyday problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing a full-stack coding bootcamp, I built projects that reflect real-world needs: a nanny-family matchmaking app, a blogging platform for caregivers, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about building tools that are intuitive, meaningful, and inclusive — especially in spaces where empathy and usability matter most.
